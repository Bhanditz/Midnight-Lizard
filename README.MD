**Midnight Lizard** is a Google **Chrome**™ and Mozilla **Firefox**™ extension that changes web page colors, brightness and contrast to increase **readability** and brings dark **night mode** to all websites.

Midnight Lizard will help you to customize an appearance of the entire internet in order to make it easier, more fun, productive and healthier to use.
It is not just a night mode, you can set up different color schemes for each of your favorite websites and one default theme for all other sites.
